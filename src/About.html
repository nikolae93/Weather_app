            Hi and welcome to the app. This is my project made from scratch, although inspired by other similar projects.
            <br> <br>
            To be honest, I was searching for popular JavaScript/Node.js projects and weather apps just piqued my interest. 
            But this project does have a practical side to it, and that is me and my friends can see the weather forecast for 
            any location at the any given time.
            <br> <br>
            This is a full-stack application meaning that I developed both the front-end and back-end. On the front-end,
             it is just pure HTML and CSS, and on the back-end, it utilizes Node.js with Express.
              I haven't used Bootstrap since I love making my CSS when I have a choice.
              <br> <br>
              However, it does use the services of APIs called DarkSky and Mapbox. DarkSky is an API that provides this
               app informations about the weather and Mapbox allows user inputs to be transformed into latitude and
                longitude needed for DarkSky API to work. 
                <br> <br>
                I can really recommend both of these since the documentations on both are resourceful and both
                 APIs are quite easy to handle. If you want to find out more, you can by following these links.

                            Hi, my name is Nikola and I am a software developer based in Belgrade, Serbia. 
                            Programming has always fascinated me, since the gymnasium where I started with Pascal
                            programming language. 
                            Since then I worked with many other tools and languages including Visual Basic, SQL, PHP, and Java but I choose
                            JavaScript as my main focus. I strive to become a competent full-stack developer and to do so I practice every
                            single day. I like programming partially because there is always something new to learn or to improve. 
                         </p>
